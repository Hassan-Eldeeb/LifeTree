------------=========  introduction ========-----------

Every person has a lot of life trends that must be handled correctly to live happily.
Those trends varies from one person to another. May be, there are common life trends among us
like financial, social, religious, healthy and educational trends and more. Our goals must
satisfy those trends, and more or less, to keep the balance of our life. Some of us are stucked
in some trends while ignoring the others. This mistake may turns his life into hell!

In this app, we are doing our best to help people keeping their life balanced, their goals
and tasks organized and timely planned.

Human resource development specialists says that, our goals can be categorised into four
categories:
	1. Urgent and Important goals
	2. Non urgent  and Important  goals
	3. Urgent and Unimportant goals
	4. Non urgent and Unimportant goals

We also help people to visualize the goals' categories to be able to schedule them correctly
and to care more about goals which belong to second category.

Schedules in this app is reusable so that a person can use fittness schedule shared by aonther
one. Schedule is a set of goals and activites belongs to this schedule which is a goal.

------------=========  Screens  ========-----------

Initially, we have seven screens:
	1. Slider  // explains how to use this app
	2. Sign in 
	3. sign up
	4. Life tree
	5. Acivites
	6. Time line
	7. User profile



1. slider

this slider explains how to use this app to manage your life in simple three steps
	a. Build your life tree's goals
	b. Map these goals into activites
	c. Put these activites into your time line

Building your life tree's goals, you have to set your life goal, divide it into smaller and
smaller goals which belongs to your life trends. Each goal you set should be one of those types:
	1. composed goal. // can be devided into smaller goals
	2. repetitive goal // can be mapped into activity
	3. simple goal // not repeatitive nor composed
you should divide composed goals into smaller goals. For example, a goal like build your company
can be devided into smaller goals like, studying necessary materials, reqrutment of team,
developing activity for this company and so on.

A goal like studying the necessary material may have a smaller goal like reading 10 books
(100 paper for each one). this goal (reading 10 books) should be mapped into
an activity like reading 10 papers daily. this activity has 100 iteration to be done. then,
put some of these iterations on your time line to be achieved.

Simple goals like visting a friend or purchasing something can be directly put to your time
line.
